### Oct 2nd - Talk: Workshop in Application of Machine Learning to Achieve Autonomous Experimentation
- Organized by Carolin Sutter-Fella (CSD, LBNL) and Marcus Noack (CRD/CAMERA, LBNL)  <details><summary> More</summary>
  The rate of scientific data acquisition is increasing at an unprecedented pace, e.g., due to faster detectors and improved computations. At the same time, in situ and high-throughput experimentation has become increasingly powerful in revealing mechanisms and synthesis-structure and structure-property relationships on multiple time and lengths scales. In this regard, efficient data evaluation requires the application of automated decision-making algorithms in order to keep pace with the data acquisition. This workshop will bring together experimentalists working on material characterization, synthesis, or high-throughput experimentation and computational researchers providing machine learning/decision-making/data-mining tools for the direct application to experiments. </details>
- Sessions run Wednesday morning in Room 54-130B
